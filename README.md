# LeapYearCalculator
First Project in Java

We all know the basic rule for calculating a leap year. Essentially, we have a leap year every 4 years, so
if the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year. However, there are a couple more restrictions that have to face while writing this code:

● check if the year is divisible by four

● if it is not, then it is not a leap year

● if it is, then it is only a leap year if it is both divisible by 100 and also evenly divisible by 400
